2576,1,alohomora,Charm,"'oh, move over,' hermione snarled. she grabbed harry’s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, 'alohomora'"
2754,1,wingardium leviosa,Charm,"'wingardium leviosal' he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill."
2757,1,wingardium leviosa,Charm,"hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, 'wingardium leviosav’"
2775,1,purple firecrackers,Charm,there was an uproar. it took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of professor dumbledore’s wand to bring silence.
2844,1,wingardium leviosa,Charm,hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; ron pulled out his own wand — not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: 'wingardium leviosal'
3570,1,locomotor,Charm,"'now, don’t forget, it’s locomotor mortis,' hermione muttered as ron slipped his wand up his sleeve."
3570,1,locomotor mortis,Curse,"'now, don’t forget, it’s locomotor mortis,' hermione muttered as ron slipped his wand up his sleeve."

4250,1,anti-cheating spell,Charm,"it was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. they had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an anti-cheating spell."
4442,1,petrificus totalus,Curse,"'petrificus totalusl' she cried, pointing it at neville."
4542,1,bluebell flames,Charm,"'oh, right!' said hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on snape at the plant. in a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free."
4561,1,alohomora,Charm,"the other two followed him. they tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn’t budge, not even when hermione tried her alohomora charm."
5468,2,hover charm,Charm,we have received intelligence that a hover charm was used at your place of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine.
7736,2,babbling curse,Curse,"since the disastrous episode of the pixies, professor lockhart had not brought live creatures to class. instead, he read passages from his books to them, and sometimes reenacted some of the more dramatic bits. he usually picked harry to help him with these reconstructions; so far, harry had been forced to play a simple transylvanian villager whom lockhart had cured of a babbling curse, a yeti with a head cold, and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything except lettuce since lockhart had dealt with him."
7741,2,homorphus charm,Charm,"and performed the immensely complex homorphus charm — he let out a piteous moan — go on, harry — higher than that — good — the fur vanished — the fangs shrank — and he turned back into a man. simple, yet effective — and another village will remember me forever as the hero who delivered them from the monthly terror of werewolf attacks.'"
8173,2,expelliarmus,Charm,"' expelliarmusv’ there was a dazzling flash of scarlet light and lockhart was blasted off his feet: he flew backward off the stage, smashed into the wall, and slid down it to sprawl on the floor."
8196,2,rictusempra,Charm,"harry swung his wand high, but malfoy had already started on 'two': his spell hit harry so hard he felt as though he’d been hit over the head with a saucepan. he stumbled, but everything still seemed to be working, and wasting no more time, harry pointed his wand straight at malfoy and shouted, 'rictusempral'"
8204,2,tarantallegra,Jinx,"'i said disarm only' lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the battling crowd, as malfoy sank to his knees; harry had hit him with a tickling charm, and he could barely move for laughing. harry hung back, with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch malfoy while he was on the floor, but this was a mistake; gasping for breath, malfoy pointed his wand at harry’s knees, choked, 'tarantallegral' and the next second harry’s legs began to jerk around out of his control in a kind of quickstep."
8206,2,finite incantatem,Counter-Spell,"'finite incantatem' he shouted; harry’s feet stopped dancing, malfoy stopped laughing, and they were able to look up."

9485,2,lumos,Charm,"harry took out his wand, murmured, 'lumos' and a tiny light appeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders."
9930,2,expelliarmus,Charm,' expelliarmus\ '
9997,2,lumos,Charm,"'lumosl' harry muttered to his wand and it lit again. 'c’mon,' he said to ron and lockhart, and off they went, their footsteps slapping loudly on the wet floor."
10024,2,obliviate,Charm,"he raised ron’s spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled, 'obliviatel'"
11087,3,lumos,Charm,"'lumos,' harry muttered, and a light appeared at the end of his wand, almost dazzling him. he held it high over his head, and the pebble-dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled; the garage door gleamed, and between them harry saw, quite distinctly, the hulking outline of something very big, with wide, gleaming eyes."
12694,3,waddiwasi,Charm,' waddiwasil ' and pointed it at peeves.
12738,3,riddikulus,Charm,"'we will practice the charm without wands first. after me, please ... riddikulusv’"
12739,3,riddikulus,Charm,' riddikulusv’ said the class together.
12768,3,riddikulus,Charm,"neville, and sees you, it will assume the form of professor snape,' said lupin. 'and you will raise your wand — thus — and cry ‘riddikulus’ — and concentrate hard on your grandmother’s clothes. if all goes well, professor boggart snape will be forced into that vulture-topped hat, and that green dress, with that big red handbag.'"
12794,3,riddikulus,Charm,'r — r — riddikulusv’ squeaked neville.
12798,3,riddikulus,Charm,'riddikulusv’ cried parvati.
12803,3,riddikulus,Charm,'riddikulusv’ shouted seamus.
12813,3,riddikulus,Charm,'riddikulusv’ yelled dean.
12819,3,riddikulus,Charm,"'riddikulusv’ bellowed ron, and the spider’s legs vanished; it rolled over and over; lavender brown squealed and ran out of its way and it came to a halt at harry’s feet. he raised his wand, ready, but —"
12828,3,riddikulus,Charm,"the legless spider had vanished. for a second, everyone looked wildly around to see where it was. then they saw a silvery-white orb hanging in the air in front of lupin, who said, 'riddikulusv’ almost lazily."
12831,3,riddikulus,Charm,"'riddikulusv’ he shouted, and they had a split second’s view of snape in his lacy dress before neville let out a great 'ha!' of laughter, and the boggart exploded, burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke, and was gone."
13448,3,impervius,Charm,"he handed them to her, and as the team watched in amazement, hermione tapped them with her wand and said, 'imperviusl'"
13750,3,dissendium,Charm,"what did he have to do? he pulled out the map again and saw, to his astonishment, that a new ink figure had appeared upon it, labeled harry potter. this figure was standing exactly where the real harry was standing, about halfway down the third-floor corridor. harry watched carefully. his little ink self appeared to be tapping the witch with his minute wand. harry quickly took out his real wand and tapped the statue. nothing happened. he looked back at the map. the tiniest speech bubble had appeared next to his figure. the word inside said, ' dissendium.'"
13753,3,lumos,Charm,"he slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide, then landed on cold, damp earth. he stood up, looking around. it was pitch dark. he held up his wand, muttered, 'lumos' and saw that he was in a very narrow, low, earthy passageway. he raised the map, tapped it with the tip of his wand, and muttered, 'mischief managed!' the map went blank at once. he folded it carefully, tucked it inside his robes, then, heart beating fast, both excited and apprehensive, he set off."
13852,3,mobiliarbus,Charm,"somewhere above him, hermione whispered, 'mobiliarbus'"
13912,3,fidelius charm,Charm,"'worse even than that, m’dear. ...' fudge dropped his voice and proceeded in a sort of low rumble. 'not many people are aware that the potters knew you- know-who was after them. dumbledore, who was of course working tirelessly against you-know-who, had a number of useful spies. one of them tipped him off, and he alerted james and lily at once. he advised them to go into hiding. well, of course, you-know- who wasn’t an easy person to hide from. dumbledore told them that their best chance was the fidelius charm.'"
13925,3,fidelius charm,Charm,"'he did,' said fudge heavily. 'and then, barely a week after the fidelius charm had been performed — '"
14424,3,expecto patronum,Charm,'the incantation is this — ' lupin cleared his throat. 'expecto patronum).'
14425,3,expecto patronum,Charm,"'expecto patronum,' harry repeated under his breath, 'expecto patronum.'"
14427,3,expecto patronum,Charm,"'oh — yeah — ' said harry, quickly forcing his thoughts back to that first broom ride. 'expecto patrono — no, patronum — sorry — expecto patronum, expecto patronum — '"

14505,3,riddikulus,Charm,"' riddikulusv’ roared lupin, springing forward."
14555,3,badgering,Transfiguration,"'no, potter, you can’t have it back yet,' professor mcgonagall told him the twelfth time this happened, before he’d even opened his mouth. 'we’ve checked for most of the usual curses, but professor flitwick believes the broom might be carrying a hurling hex. i shall tell you once we’ve finished checking it. now, please stop badgering me.'"
14555,3,hurling hex,Hex,"'no, potter, you can’t have it back yet,' professor mcgonagall told him the twelfth time this happened, before he’d even opened his mouth. 'we’ve checked for most of the usual curses, but professor flitwick believes the broom might be carrying a hurling hex. i shall tell you once we’ve finished checking it. now, please stop badgering me.'"
14732,3,lumos,Charm,"harry pointed. ron pulled out his wand and muttered, 'lumos'"
14819,3,expecto patronum,Charm,"he didn’t stop to think. plunging a hand down the neck of his robes, he whipped out his wand and roared, 'expecto patronum).'"
15058,3,dissendium,Charm,"' dissendium).' and shoved his bag into the statue, but before he could climb in himself, neville came around the corner."
15179,3,apparition,Transportation,'mr. malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition.
15379,3,cheering charm,Charm,"'you’re late, boys!' said professor flitwick reprovingly as harry opened the classroom door. 'come along, quickly, wands out, we’re experimenting with cheering charms today, we’ve already divided into pairs — '"
15391,3,cheering charm,Charm,"'she could’ve done with a cheering charm on her too,' said ron as the class left for lunch, all grinning broadly — the cheering charms had left them with a feeling of great contentment."
15392,3,cheering charm,Charm,"hermione wasn’t at lunch either. by the time they had finished their apple pie, the after-effects of the cheering charms were wearing off, and harry and ron had started to get slightly worried."
15410,3,cheering charm,Charm,'i can’t believe i missed cheering charms! and i bet they come up in our exams; professor flitwick hinted they might!'
15436,3,cheering charm,Charm,"'this is such a waste of time,' hermione hissed. 'i could be practicing something useful. i could be catching up on cheering charms — '"
15727,3,cheering charm,Charm,"then, after a hasty lunch, it was straight back upstairs for the charms exam. hermione had been right; professor flitwick did indeed test them on cheering charms. harry slightly overdid his out of nerves and ron, who was partnering him, ended up in fits of hysterical laughter and had to be led away to a quiet room for an hour before he was ready to perform the charm himself. after dinner, the students hurried back to their common rooms, not to relax, but to start studying for care of magical creatures, potions, and astronomy."
15871,3,dissendium,Charm,"'you — you tap it and say, ‘dissendium,’ ' said harry. 'but — '"
16027,3,lumos,Charm,'lumos' he whispered.
16080,3,nox,Charm,"'nox,' they whispered together, and the lights at the end of their wands went out. only one door was open. as they crept toward it, they heard movement from behind it; a low moan, and then a deep, loud purring. they exchanged a last look, a last nod."
16095,3,expelliarmus,Charm,"' expelliarmusv’ he croaked, pointing ron’s wand at them."
16167,3,expelliarmus,Charm,' expelliarmusv’ lupin shouted.
16455,3,expelliarmus,Charm,"' expelliarmus' he yelled — except that his wasn’t the only voice that shouted. there was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges; snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall, then slid down it to the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair. he had been knocked out."
16702,3,ferula,"Conjuration, Healing spell","he hurried over to ron, bent down, tapped ron’s leg with his wand, and muttered, 'ferula.' bandages spun up ron’s leg, strapping it tightly to a splint. lupin helped him to his feet; ron put his weight gingerly on the leg and didn’t wince."
16712,3,mobilicorpus,Charm,"he muttered, 'mobilicorpus.' as though invisible strings were tied to snape’s wrists, neck, and knees, he was pulled into a standing position, head still lolling unpleasantly, like a grotesque puppet. he hung a few inches above the ground, his limp feet dangling. lupin picked up the invisibility cloak and tucked it safely into his pocket."
16783,3,expelliarmus,Charm,"' expelliarmusv’ harry yelled, pointing his own wand at pettigrew; lupin’s wand flew high into the air and out of sight. 'stay where you are!' harry shouted, running forward."
16814,3,expecto patronum,Charm,"he forced himself to think of black, and only black, and began to chant: 'expecto patronum). expecto patronum).'"

16824,3,expecto patronum,Charm,"'expecto patronum' harry yelled, trying to blot the screaming from his ears. 'expecto patronum.'"

18463,4,incendio,"Charm, Conjuration","'incendio' said mr. weasley, pointing his wand at the hole in the wall behind him."
18806,4,apparition,Transportation,"'oh yes,' said mr. weasley, tucking the tickets safely into the back pocket of his jeans. 'the department of magical transportation had to fine a couple of people the other day for apparating without a license. it’s not easy, apparition, and when it’s not done properly it can lead to nasty complications. this pair i’m talking about went and splinched themselves.'"
18813,4,apparition,Transportation,"'oh yes,' said mr. weasley matter-of-factly. 'but they got a heavy fine, and i don’t think they’ll be trying it again in a hurry. you don’t mess around with apparition. there are plenty of adult wizards who don’t bother with it. prefer brooms — slower, but safer.'"
18836,4,accio,Charm,"mrs. weasley pointed her wand at george’s pocket and said, 'acciol'"
18840,4,accio,Charm,"'acciol acciol acciol' she shouted, and toffees zoomed from all sorts of unlikely places, including the lining of george’s jacket and the turn-ups of fred’s jeans."
18853,4,apparition,Transportation,"'it’s been a massive organizational problem,' sighed mr. weasley. 'the trouble is, about a hundred thousand wizards turn up at the world cup, and of course, we just haven’t got a magical site big enough to accommodate them all. there are places muggles can’t penetrate, but imagine trying to pack a hundred thousand wizards into diagon alley or platform nine and three-quarters. so we had to find a nice deserted moor, and set up as many anti-muggle precautions as possible. the whole ministry’s been working on it for months. first, of course, we have to stagger the arrivals. people with cheaper tickets have to arrive two weeks beforehand. a limited number use muggle transport, but we can’t have too many clogging up their buses and trains — remember, wizards are coming from all over the world. some apparate, of course, but we have to set up safe points for them to appear, well away from muggles. i believe there’s a handy wood they’re using as the apparition point. for those who don’t want to apparate, or can’t, we use portkeys. they’re objects that are used to transport wizards from one spot to another at a prearranged time. you can do large groups at a time if you need to. there have been two hundred portkeys placed at page | 77 harry potter and the goblet of fire - j.k. rowling"
18896,4,apparition,Transportation,"'had to get up at two, didn’t we, ced? i tell you, i’ll be glad when he’s got his apparition test. still ... not complaining ... quidditch world cup, wouldn’t miss it for a sackful of galleons — and the tickets cost about that. mind you, looks like i got off easy. ...' amos diggory peered good-naturedly around at the three weasley boys, harry, hermione, and ginny. 'all these yours, arthur?'"
18994,4,obliviate,Charm,"'obliviate' he said sharply, pointing his wand at mr. roberts."
19383,4,sonorus,Charm,"ludo whipped out his wand, directed it at his own throat, and said 'sonorusl' and then spoke over the roar of sound that was now filling the packed stadium; his voice echoed over them, booming into every corner of the stands."
19596,4,quietus,Charm,"at last, when the irish team had left the box to perform another lap of honor on their brooms (aidan lynch on the back of connolly’s, clutching hard around his waist and still grinning in a bemused sort of way), bagman pointed his wand at his throat and muttered, 'quietus.'"
19662,4,lumos,Charm,"'what happened?' said hermione anxiously, stopping so abruptly that harry walked into her. 'ron, where are you? oh this is stupid — lumos'"
19800,4,morsmordre,,'morsmordrel '
19824,4,stupefy,Charm,"'stupefyl' roared twenty voices — there was a blinding series of flashes and harry felt the hair on his head ripple as though a powerful wind had swept the clearing. raising his head a fraction of an inch he saw jets of fiery red light flying over them from the wizards’ wands, crossing one another, bouncing off tree trunks, rebounding into the darkness —"
19900,4,rennervate,Charm,"crouch gave no sign that he had heard mr. diggory, but mr. diggory seemed to take his silence for assent. he raised his own wand, pointed it at winky, and said, 'rennervatel'"
19946,4,prior incantato,Charm,' prior incantatol' roared mr. diggory.
19948,4,deletrius,Charm,"'deletrius' mr. diggory shouted, and the smoky skull vanished in a wisp of smoke."
20541,4,reparo,Charm,"'ronl' said hermione reproachfully, and she pulled out her wand, muttered ' reparov ’ and the glass shards flew back into a single pane and back into the door."
21275,4,imperio,Curse,"moody reached into the jar, caught one of the spiders, and held it in the palm of his hand so that they could all see it. he then pointed his wand at it and muttered, 'imperio'"
21311,4,engorgio,Charm,"'the cruciatus curse,' said moody. 'needs to be a bit bigger for you to get the idea,' he said, pointing his wand at the spider. 'engorgio'"
21313,4,crucio,Curse,"moody raised his wand again, pointed it at the spider, and muttered, 'cruciov’"
21320,4,reducio,Charm,"'reducio,' moody muttered, and the spider shrank back to its proper size. he put it back into the jar."
21336,4,avada kedavra,Curse,"'avada kedavra,' hermione whispered."
21338,4,avada kedavra,Curse,"'ah,' said moody, another slight smile twisting his lopsided mouth. 'yes, the last and worst. avada kedavra ... the killing curse.'"
21341,4,avada kedavra,Curse,'avada kedavral' moody roared.
21359,4,avada kedavra,Curse,"'avada kedavra’s a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it — you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words, and i doubt i’d get so much as a nosebleed. but that doesn’t matter. i’m not here to teach you how to do it."
21361,4,avada kedavra,Curse,"'now ... those three curses — avada kedavra, imperius, and cruciatus — are known as the unforgivable curses. the use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in azkaban. that’s what you’re up against. that’s what i’ve got to teach you to fight. you need preparing. you need arming. but most of all, you need to practice constant, never-ceasing vigilance. get out your quills ... copy this down. ...'"
21403,4,avada kedavra,Curse,"'some lesson, though, eh?' said ron to harry as they set off for the great hall. 'fred and george were right, weren’t they? he really knows his stuff, moody, doesn’t he? when he did avada kedavra, the way that spider just died, just snuffed it right — '"
21608,4,imperio,Curse,"harry moved forward into the middle of the classroom, into the space that moody had cleared of desks. moody raised his wand, pointed it at harry, and said, 'imperio'"
21698,4,switching spell,Transfiguration,"'longbottom, kindly do not reveal that you can’t even perform a simple switching spell in front of anyone from durmstrang!' professor mcgonagall barked at the end of one particularly difficult lesson, during which neville had accidentally transplanted his own ears onto a cactus."
21734,4,badgering,Transfiguration,"harry shook his head and applied himself to his scrambled eggs. his and ron’s lack of enthusiasm had done nothing whatsoever to curb hermione ’s determination to pursue justice for house-elves. true, both of them had paid two sickles for a s.p.e.w. badge, but they had only done it to keep her quiet. their sickles had been wasted, however; if anything, they seemed to have made hermione more vociferous. she had been badgering harry and ron ever since, first to wear the badges, then to persuade others to do the same, and she had also taken to rattling around the gryffindor common room every evening, cornering people and shaking the collecting tin under their noses."
21836,4,imperio,Curse,"'come,' said madame maxime imperiously to her students, and the hogwarts crowd parted to allow her and her students to pass up the stone steps."
22021,4,age line,Charm,"'to ensure that no underage student yields to temptation,' said dumbledore, 'i will be drawing an age line around the goblet of fire once it has been placed in the entrance hall. nobody under the age of seventeen will be able to cross this line."
22024,4,age line,Charm,"'an age line!' fred weasley said, his eyes glinting, as they all made their way across the hall to the doors into the entrance hall. 'well, that should be fooled by an aging potion, shouldn’t it? and once your name’s in that goblet, you’re laughing — it can’t tell whether you’re seventeen or not!'"
22036,4,age line,Charm,"harry thought briefly of dumbledore ’s insistence that nobody under seventeen should submit their name, but then the wonderful picture of himself winning the triwizard tournament filled his mind again. ... he wondered how angry dumbledore would be if someone younger than seventeen did find a way to get over the age line. ..."
22142,4,age line,Charm,"madame maxime entered the hall behind her students and organized them into a line. one by one, the beauxbatons students stepped across the age line and dropped their slips of parchment into the blue- white flames. as each name entered the fire, it turned briefly red and emitted sparks."
22339,4,imperio,Curse,"'what is ze meaning of zis, dumbly-dorr?' she said imperiously."
22343,4,age line,Charm,"'we were under the impression that your age line would keep out younger contestants, dumbledore,' said karkaroff, his steely smile still in place, though his eyes were colder than ever. 'otherwise, we would, of course, have brought along a wider selection of candidates from our own schools.'"
22361,4,age line,Charm,"'he could not have crossed the age line,' said professor mcgonagall sharply. 'i am sure we are all agreed on that — '"

'we’ll be on hand if it gets nasty, extinguishing spells at the ready. they wanted nesting mothers, i don’t know why ... but i tell you this, i don’t envy the one who gets the horntail. vicious thing. its back end’s as dangerous as its front, look.'"
23352,4,switching spell,Transfiguration,"'well, there are switching spells ... but what’s the point of switching it? unless you swapped its fangs for wine-gums or something that would make it less dangerous. ... the trouble is, like that book said, not much is going to get through a dragon’s hide. ... i’d say transfigure it, but something that big, you really haven’t got a hope, i doubt even professor mcgonagall ... unless you’re supposed to put the spell on yourself? maybe to give yourself extra powers? but they’re not simple spells, i mean, we haven’t done any of those in class, i only know about them because i’ve been doing o.w.l. practice papers. ...'"

24492,4,conjunctivitis curse,Curse,"congratulations on getting past the horntail. whoever put your name in that goblet shouldn’t be feeling too happy right now! i was going to suggest a conjunctivitis curse, as a dragon’s eyes are its weakest point — 'that’s what krum did!' hermione whispered — but your way was better, i’m impressed."

25986,4,sonorus,Charm,"bagman gave harry’s shoulder a quick squeeze and returned to the judges’ table; he pointed his wand at his throat as he had done at the world cup, said, 'sonorusl' and his voice boomed out across the dark water toward the stands."
26012,4,relashio,Jinx,"'relashio' harry shouted, except that no sound came out. ... a large bubble issued from his mouth, and his wand, instead of sending sparks at the grindylows, pelted them with what seemed to be a jet of boiling water, for where it struck them, angry red patches appeared on their green skin. harry pulled his ankle out of the grindylows grip and swam, as fast as he could, occasionally sending more jets of hot water over his shoulder at random; every now and then he felt one of the grindylows snatch at his foot again, and he kicked out, hard; finally, he felt his foot connect with a horned skull, and looking back, saw the dazed grindylow floating away, cross-eyed, while its fellows shook their fists at harry and sank back into the weed."

26378,4,imperio,Curse,"then, at last, sirius slipped out of sight, and when they reached the place where he had vanished, they saw a narrow fissure in the rock. they squeezed into it and found themselves in a cool, dimly lit cave. tethered at the end of it, one end of his rope around a large rock, was buckbeak the hippogriff. half gray horse, half giant eagle, buckbeak’s fierce orange eye flashed at the sight of them. all three of them bowed low to him, and after regarding them imperiously for a moment, buckbeak bent his scaly front knees and allowed hermione to rush forward and stroke his feathery neck. harry, however, was looking at the black dog, which had just turned into his godfather."

27943,4,reducto,Curse,"tired of walking in on harry, hermione, and ron all over the school, professor mcgonagall had given them permission to use the empty transfiguration classroom at lunchtimes. harry had soon mastered the impediment curse, a spell to slow down and obstruct attackers; the reductor curse, which would enable him to blast solid objects out of his way; and the four-point spell, a useful discovery of hermione’s that would make his wand point due north, therefore enabling him to check whether he was going in the right direction within the maze. he was still having trouble with the shield charm, though. this was page | 673 harry potter and the goblet of fire - j.k. rowling"
28122,4,sonorus,Charm,"'good luck, harry,' hagrid whispered, and the four of them walked away in different directions, to station themselves around the maze. bagman now pointed his wand at his throat, muttered, ' sonorus,' and his magically magnified voice echoed into the stands."
28132,4,lumos,Charm,"the towering hedges cast black shadows across the path, and, whether because they were so tall and thick or because they had been enchanted, the sound of the surrounding crowd was silenced the moment they entered the maze. harry felt almost as though he were underwater again. he pulled out his wand, muttered, 'lumos,' and heard cedric do the same just behind him."

28304,4,stupefy,Charm,"'stupefy'.' harry yelled; the spell hit the spider’s gigantic, hairy black body, but for all the good it did, he might as well have thrown a stone at it; the spider jerked, scuttled around, and ran at harry instead."

33115,5,permanent sticking charm,Charm,"it was odd how widely their possessions seemed to have scattered themselves since they had arrived. it took them most of the afternoon to retrieve their books and belongings from all over the house and stow them back inside their school trunks. harry noticed that ron kept moving his prefect’s badge around, first placing it on his bedside table, then putting it into his jeans pocket, then taking it out and laying it on his folded robes, as though to see the effect of the red on the black. only when fred and george dropped in and offered to attach it to his forehead with a permanent sticking charm did he wrap it tenderly in his maroon socks and lock it in his trunk."

34275,5,green sparks,,"harry, who was sweating profusely, looked desperately around the dungeon. his own cauldron was issuing copious amounts of dark gray steam; ron’s was spitting green sparks. seamus was feverishly prodding the flames at the base of his cauldron with the tip of his wand, as they had gone out. the surface of hermione’s potion, however, was a shimmering mist of silver vapor, and as snape swept by he looked down his hooked nose at it without comment, which meant that he could find nothing to criticize. at harry’s cauldron, however, snape stopped, looking down at harry with a horrible smirk on his face."

35389,5,inanimatus conjurus,Transfiguration,"'you know, we probably should try and get more homework done during the week,' harry muttered to ron, as they finally laid aside professor mcgonagall’s long essay on the inanimatus conjurus spell and turned miserably to professor sinistra ’s equally long and difficult essay about jupiter’s moons."
36046,5,reparo,Charm,"'reparo,' harry muttered, pointing his wand at the broken pieces of china. they flew back together, good as new, but there was no returning the murtlap essence to the bowl."
36861,5,accio,Charm,harry pointed his wand at the bullfrog that had been hopping hopefully toward the other side of the table — 'acciol ' — and it zoomed gloomily back into his hand.

36879,5,silencio,Charm,"'silenciol' said hermione hastily, pointing her wand at harry’s frog, which deflated silently before them. 'well, he mustn’t do it again, that’s all. i just don’t know how we’re going to let him know. we can’t send him an owl.'"
36880,5,silencio,Charm,"'i don’t reckon he’ll risk it again,' said ron. 'he’s not stupid, he knows she nearly got him. silenciol'"

36967,5,impervius,Charm,they squelched through the deepening mud to the middle of the pitch; visibility was still very poor even with the impervius charm; light was fading fast and curtains of rain were sweeping the grounds.
37227,5,expelliarmus,Charm,"'right,' said harry, when she had sat down again, 'shall we get practicing then? i was thinking, the first thing we should do is expelliarmus, you know, the disarming charm. i know it’s pretty basic but i’ve found it really useful — '"
37228,5,expelliarmus,Charm,"'oh please,' said zacharias smith, rolling his eyes and folding his arms. 'i don’t think expelliarmus is exactly going to help us against you-know-who, do you?'"
37240,5,expelliarmus,Charm,"the room was suddenly full of shouts of 'expelliarmusl': wands flew in all directions, missed spells hit books on shelves and sent them flying into the air. harry was too quick for neville, whose wand went spinning out of his hand, hit the ceiling in a shower of sparks, and landed with a clatter on top of a bookshelf, from which harry retrieved it with a summoning charm. glancing around he thought he had been right to suggest that they practice the basics first; there was a lot of shoddy spellwork going on; many people were not succeeding in disarming their opponents at all, but merely causing them to jump backward a few paces or wince as the feeble spell whooshed over them."
37241,5,expelliarmus,Charm,"'expelliarmusl' said neville, and harry, caught unawares, felt his wand fly out of his hand."
37287,5,expelliarmus,Charm,"everybody stopped shouting, ' expelliarmusl' and the last couple of wands clattered to the floor."
37314,5,reducto,Curse,"harry felt as though he were carrying some kind of talisman inside his chest over the following two weeks, a glowing secret that supported him through umbridge’s classes and even made it possible for him to smile blandly as he looked into her horrible bulging eyes. he and the d.a. were resisting her under her very nose, doing the very thing that she and the ministry most feared, and whenever he was supposed to be reading wilbert slinkhard’s book during her lessons he dwelled instead on satisfying memories of their most recent meetings, remembering how neville had successfully disarmed hermione, how colin creevey had mastered the impediment jinx after three meetings’ hard effort, how parvati patil had produced such a good reductor curse that she had reduced the table carrying all the sneakoscopes to dust."
37321,5,protean charm,Charm,"'you see the numerals around the edge of the coins?' hermione said, holding one up for examination at the end of their fourth meeting. the coin gleamed fat and yellow in the light from the torches. 'on real galleons that’s just a serial number referring to the goblin who cast the coin. on these fake coins, though, the numbers will change to reflect the time and date of the next meeting. the coins will grow hot when the date changes, so if you’re carrying them in a pocket you’ll be able to feel them. we take one each, and when harry sets the date of the next meeting he’ll change the numbers on his coin, and because i’ve put a protean charm on them, they’ll all change to mimic his.'"

37575,5,impedimenta,Jinx,"he could hear girls’ voices screaming, malfoy yelling, george swearing, a whistle blowing, and the bellowing of the crowd around him, but he did not care, not until somebody in the vicinity yelled ' impedimenta !' and only when he was knocked over backward by the force of the spell did he abandon the attempt to punch every inch of malfoy he could reach..."

38324,5,impedimenta,Jinx,"they all divided up obediently; harry partnered neville as usual. the room was soon full of intermittent cries of ' impedimental ' people froze for a minute or so, during which their partners would stare aimlessly around the room watching other pairs at work, then would unfreeze and take their turn at the jinx."
38647,5,portus,Charm,"dumbledore was now rummaging in a cupboard behind harry and ron. he emerged from it carrying a blackened old kettle, which he placed carefully upon his desk. he raised his wand and murmured 'portus'; for a moment the kettle trembled, glowing with an odd blue light, then it quivered to a rest, as solidly black as ever."

39408,5,nox,Charm,"harry did not mention his vague suspicions to sirius, whose cheerfulness was evaporating fast now that christmas was over. as the date of their departure back to hogwarts drew nearer, he became more and more prone to what mrs. weasley called 'fits of the sullens,' in which he would become taciturn and grumpy, often withdrawing to buckbeak’s room for hours at a time. his gloom seeped through the house, oozing under doorways like some noxious gas, so that all of them became infected by it."

'i don’t remember telling you to use a shield charm . . . but there is no doubt that it was effective...'"

42249,5,bubble-head charm,Charm,"inspired by fred and george’s example, a great number of students were now vying for the newly vacant positions of troublemakers-in-chief. in spite of the new door, somebody managed to slip a hairy- snouted niffler into umbridge ’s office, which promptly tore the place apart in its search for shiny objects, leapt on umbridge on her re-entrance, and tried to gnaw the rings off her stubby fingers. dungbombs and stinkpellets were dropped so frequently in the corridors that it became the new fashion for students to perform bubble-head charms on themselves before leaving lessons, which ensured them a supply of fresh clean air, even though it gave them all the peculiar appearance of wearing upside-down goldfish bowls on their heads."

42870,5,cheering charm,Charm,"'well, it wasn’t too bad, was it?' asked hermione anxiously in the entrance hall two hours later, still clutching the exam paper. 'i’m not sure i did myself justice on cheering charms, i just ran out of time — did you put in the countercharm for hiccups? i wasn’t sure whether i ought to, it felt like too much — and on question twenty-three — '"
42896,5,switching spell,Transfiguration,"he forgot the definition of a switching spell during his written exam next morning, but thought his practical could have been a lot worse. at least he managed to vanish the whole of his iguana, whereas poor hannah abbott lost her head completely at the next table and somehow managed to multiply her ferret into a flock of flamingos, causing the examination to be halted for ten minutes while the birds were captured and carried out of the hall."

43364,5,stealth sensoring spell,Charm,"'you think,' she whispered, bending harry’s neck back even farther, so that he was looking up at the ceiling above him, 'that after two nifflers i was going to let one more foul, scavenging little creature enter my office without my knowledge? i had stealth sensoring spells placed all around my doorway after the last one got in, you foolish boy. take his wand,' she barked at someone he could not see, and he felt a hand grope inside the chest pocket of his robes and remove the wand. 'hers too ...'"
43595,5,incarcerous,Conjuration,"'be quiet!' shouted hermione, but it was too late — umbridge pointed her wand at magorian and screamed, ' incarcerousl'"
43690,5,bat-bogey hex,Hex,"'couple of stunners, a disarming charm, neville brought off a really nice little impediment jinx,' said ron airily, now handing back hermione’s wand too.

44206,5,stupefy,Charm,"ginny, and luna sprint past him, their arms over their heads. something heavy struck him on the side of the face but he merely ducked his head and sprinted onward; a hand caught him by the shoulder; he heard hermione shout 'stupefy' and the hand released him at once."

44233,5,expelliarmus,Charm,"harry launched himself across the floor and grabbed the death eater around the knees, causing him to topple and his aim to go awry. neville overturned his desk in his anxiety to help; pointing his wand wildly at the struggling pair he cried, 'expelliarmus'"
44245,5,stupefy,Charm,"harry flung himself sideways as neville took aim again and shouted, ' stupefy !'"
44250,5,stupefy,Charm,"'stupefy]' screamed hermione, who had just caught up with them. the jet of red light hit the death eater in the middle of his chest; he froze, his arm still raised, his wand fell to the floor with a clatter and he collapsed backward toward the bell jar. harry expected to hear a clunk, for the man to hit solid glass and slide off the jar onto the floor, but instead, his head sank through the surface of the bell jar as though it was nothing but a soap bubble and he came to rest, sprawled on his back on the table, with his head lying inside the jar full of glittering wind."
44251,5,accio,Charm,'accio wand' cried hermione. harry’s wand flew from a dark corner into her hand and she threw it to him.
44284,5,silencio,Charm,"' silenciol ' cried hermione, and the man’s voice was extinguished. he continued to mouth through the hole in his mask, but no sound came out; he was thrust aside by his fellow."
44285,5,petrificus totalus,Curse,"'petrificus totalusl' shouted harry, as the second death eater raised his wand. his arms and legs snapped together and he fell forward, facedown onto the rug at harry’s feet, stiff as a board and unable to move at all."

44473,5,stupefy,Charm,"neville had come lunging out of nowhere: unable to articulate a spell, he had jabbed hermione’s wand hard into the eyehole of the death eater’s mask. the man relinquished harry at once with a howl of pain and harry whirled around to face him and gasped, 'stupefy]'"
44482,5,protego,Charm,"he made the same slashing movement with his wand that he had used on hermione just as harry yelled, 'protego'"

44504,5,impedimenta,Jinx,"harry flung the prophecy across the floor, neville spun himself around on his back and scooped the ball to his chest. malfoy pointed the wand instead at neville, but harry jabbed his own wand back over his shoulder and yelled, 'impedimental'"
44609,5,crucio,Curse,hatred rose in harry such as he had never known before. he flung himself out from behind the fountain and bellowed 'cruciov’
44612,5,crucio,Curse,"harry had been edging around the fountain on the other side. she screamed, 'cruciol' and he was forced to duck down again as the centaur’s arm, holding its bow, spun off and landed with a crash on the floor a short distance from the golden wizard’s head."
44619,5,stupefy,Charm,'stupefy' yelled harry. he had edged right around to where the goblin stood beaming up at the now headless wizard and taken aim at her back as she peered around the fountain for him. she reacted so fast he barely had time to duck.

46219,6,imperio,Curse,"but the rest of this story was obscured by the large birdcage standing on top of it. inside it was a magnificent snowy owl. her amber eyes surveyed the room imperiously, her head swiveling occasionally to gaze at her snoring master. once or twice she clicked her beak impatiently, but harry was too deeply asleep to hear her."

46755,6,apparition,Transportation,"braced this time, harry was ready for the apparition, but still found it unpleasant. when the pressure disappeared and he found himself able to breathe again, he was standing in a country lane beside dumbledore and looking ahead to the crooked silhouette of his second favorite building in the world: the burrow. in spite of the feeling of dread that had just swept through him, his spirits could not help but lift at the sight of it. ron was in there ... and so was mrs. weasley, who could cook better than anyone he knew. ..."

48172,6,tergeo,Charm,"she raised her wand, said 'tergeol' and siphoned off the dried blood."

48916,6,relashio,Jinx,"both harry and ogden yelled 'no!' at the same time; ogden raised his wand and cried, 'relashiol' gaunt was thrown backward, away from his daughter; he tripped over a chair and fell flat on his back. with a roar of rage, morfin leapt out of his chair and ran at ogden, brandishing his bloody knife and firing hexes indiscriminately from his wand."

49313,6,muffliato,Charm,"harry had already attempted a few of the prince’s self- invented spells. there had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had tried this on crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which he had twice used, to general applause, on an unsuspecting argus filch); and, perhaps most useful of all, muffliato, a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class without being overheard. the only person who did not find these charms amusing was hermione, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and refused to talk at all if harry had used the muffliato spell on anyone in the vicinity."

50056,6,reparo,Charm,"'reparo,' he said hastily, poking the pieces with his wand, and the bowl sprang back together again. the crash, however, appeared to have awoken ron and hermione to harry’s presence. hermione looked flustered and immediately started fussing about for her copy of flesh-eating trees of the world to find out the correct way to juice snargaluff pods; ron, on the other hand, looked sheepish but also rather pleased with himself."
50086,6,episkey,Healing Spell,"'i can fix that,' said harry, landing beside the two girls, pointing his wand at demelza’s mouth, and saying 'episkey.' 'and ginny, don’t call ron a prat, you’re not the captain of this team — '"

51237,6,apparition,Transportation,"'so — apparition,' said ron, his tone making it perfectly plain that harry was not to mention what had just happened. 'should be a laugh, eh?'"
51252,6,apparition,Transportation,ron was not the only one to be excited at the prospect of apparition. all that day there was much talk about the forthcoming lessons; a great deal of store was set by being able to vanish and reappear at will.
51261,6,apparition,Transportation,"'harry’s already apparated,' ron told a slightly abashed seamus, after professor flitwick had dried himself off with a wave of his wand and set seamus lines: 'i am a wizard, not a baboon brandishing a stick.' 'dum — er — someone took him. side-along- apparition, you know.'"
51262,6,apparition,Transportation,"'whoa!' whispered seamus, and he, dean, and neville put their heads a little closer to hear what apparition felt like. for the rest of the day, harry was besieged with requests from the other sixth years to describe the sensation of apparition. all of them seemed awed, rather than put off, when he told them how uncomfortable it was, and he was still answering detailed questions at ten to eight that evening, when he was forced to lie and say that he needed to return a book to the library, so as to escape in time for his lesson with dumbledore."
51409,6,avada kedavra,Curse,"'the muggle authorities were perplexed. as far as i am aware, they do not know to this day how the riddles died, for the avada kedavra curse does not usually leave any sign of damage. ... the exception sits before me,' dumbledore added, with a nod to harry’s scar. 'the ministry, on the other hand, knew at once that this was a wizard’s murder. they also knew that a convicted muggle-hater lived across the valley from the riddle house, a muggle-hater who had already been imprisoned once for attacking one of the murdered people."

51622,6,reverte,Charm,"when harry did not question slughorn again, the potions master reverted to his usual affectionate treatment of him, and appeared to have put the matter from his mind. harry awaited an invitation to one of his little evening parties, determined to accept this time, even if he had to reschedule quidditch practice. unfortunately, however, no such invitation arrived. harry checked with hermione and ginny: neither of them had received an invitation and nor, as page | 428 harry potter and the half blood prince - j.k. rowling"
51629,6,apparition,Transportation,"the snow melted around the school as february arrived, to be replaced by cold, dreary wetness. purplish-gray clouds hung low over the castle and a constant fall of chilly rain made the lawns slippery and muddy. the upshot of this was that the sixth years’ first apparition lesson, which was scheduled for a saturday morning so that no normal lessons would be missed, took place in the great hall instead of in the grounds."
51634,6,apparition,Transportation,"mcgonagall, snape, flitwick, and sprout — the heads of houses — and a small wizard whom harry took to be the apparition instructor from the ministry. he was oddly colorless, with transparent eyelashes, wispy hair, and an insubstantial air, as though a single gust of wind might blow him away. harry wondered whether constant disappearances and reappearances had somehow diminished his substance, or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wishing to vanish."
51635,6,apparition,Transportation,"'good morning,' said the ministry wizard, when all the students had arrived and the heads of houses had called for quiet. 'my name is wilkie twycross and i shall be your ministry apparition instructor for the next twelve weeks. i hope to be able to prepare you for your apparition tests in this time — '"

51754,6,apparition,Transportation,"harry tapped the map with his wand, muttered, 'mischief managed,' though it hadn’t been, and got dressed, thinking hard. there had to be an explanation for malfoy’s periodic disappearances, but he simply could not think what it could be. the best way of finding out would be to tail him, but even with the invisibility cloak this was an impractical idea: harry had lessons, quidditch practice, homework, and apparition; he could not follow malfoy around school all day without his absence being remarked upon."
51800,6,levicorpus,Jinx,harry reacted instinctively; his wand was out of his pocket and the incantation sprang to mind without conscious thought: levicorpus\
52023,6,nox,Charm,'and what difference does that make?' asked filch obnoxiously.
52225,6,muffliato,Charm,"harry pointed his wand hastily at the door of madam pomfrey’s office and muttered, 'muffliatov’ so that she would not come running. then he scrambled to the end of his bed for a better look at what was going on."
52239,6,langlock,Jinx,"harry aimed his wand at peeves and said, 'langlockl' peeves clutched at his throat, gulped, then swooped from the room making obscene gestures but unable to speak, owing to the fact that his tongue had just glued itself to the roof of his mouth."
52245,6,muffliato,Charm,"'yeah, i did,' said harry, glancing toward madam pomfrey’s office door to check that the muffliato spell was still working; there was no sign that she had heard any of the commotion. 'i’ve got a job for you.'"
52287,6,reparo,Charm,"she tapped the broken scales with her wand and said, 'reparo.' the girl did not say thank you, but remained rooted to the spot as they passed and watched them out of sight; ron glanced back at her."
52346,6,apparition,Transportation,"'ah,' said harry, brought up short. what with apparition lessons and quidditch and ron being poisoned and getting his skull cracked and his determination to find out what draco malfoy was up to, harry had almost forgotten about the memory dumbledore had asked him to extract from professor slughorn. 'well, i asked professor slughorn about it at the end of potions, sir, but, er, he wouldn’t give it to me.'"

52644,6,apparition,Transportation,"ron had panicked on reading this notice; he had still not managed to apparate and feared he would not be ready for the test. hermione, who had now achieved apparition twice, was a little more confident, but harry, who would not be seventeen for another four months, could not take the test whether ready or not."
52647,6,apparition,Transportation,"having wasted a lot of time worrying aloud about apparition, ron was now struggling to finish a viciously difficult essay for snape that harry and hermione had already completed. harry fully expected to receive low marks on his, because he had disagreed with snape on the best way to tackle dementors, but he did not care: slughorn’s memory was the most important thing to him now."
52772,6,apparition,Transportation,"'wish i could disapparate like a house-elf,' said ron, staring at the spot where dobby had vanished. 'i’d have that apparition test in the bag.'"
52848,6,apparition,Transportation,"and abused snape hotly for his jibe about ron’s apparition, but this seemed to merely irritate ron, and he shook her off by making a detour into the boys’ bathroom with harry."

61015,7,fidelius charm,Charm,"he could see it; the fidelius charm must have died with james and lily. the hedge had grown wild in the sixteen years since hagrid had taken harry from the rubble that lay scattered amongst the waist-high grass. most of the cottage was still standing, though entirely covered in dark ivy and snow, but the right side of the top floor had been blown apart; that, harry was sure, was where the curse had backfired. he and hermione stood at the gate, gazing up at the wreck of what must once have been a cottage just like those that flanked it."
61081,7,tergeo,Charm,"the last surface on which harry spotted a candle was a bow-fronted chest of drawers on which there stood a large number of photographs. when the flame danced into life, its reflection wavered on their dusty glass and silver. he saw a few tiny movements from the pictures. as bathilda fumbled with logs for the fire, he muttered ' tergeo ': the dust vanished from the photographs, and he saw at once that half a dozen were missing from the largest and most ornate frames. he wondered whether bathilda or somebody else had removed them. then the sight of a photograph near the back of the collection caught his eye, and he snatched it up."
61128,7,lumos,Charm,"'lumos,' said harry, and his wand ignited. he gave a start: bathilda had moved close to him in those few seconds of darkness, and he had not heard her approach."

62454,7,hover charm,Charm,harry held out his left hand. ron vanished beneath the cloak. the printing press blocking the stairs was vibrating: xenophilius was trying to shift it using a hover charm. harry did not know what hermione was waiting for.

63331,7,stupefy,Charm,"' expelliarmusv’ he roared, pointing wormtail’s wand at bellatrix, and hers flew into the air and was caught by harry, who had sprinted after ron. lucius, narcissa, draco, and greyback wheeled about; harry yelled, 'stupefy' and lucius malfoy collapsed onto the hearth. jets of light flew from draco’s, narcissa’s, and greyback’s wands; harry threw himself to the floor, rolling behind a sofa to avoid them."

63346,7,stupefy,Charm,"as ron ran to pull hermione out of the wreckage, harry took his chance: he leapt over an armchair and wrested the three wands from draco’s grip, pointed all of them at greyback, and yelled, 'stupefyl' the werewolf was lifted off his feet by the triple spell, flew up to the ceiling, and then smashed to the ground."

63795,7,disillusionment charm,Charm,"snape bowed and set off back up the path, his black cloak billowing behind him. harry walked slowly, waiting for snape ’s figure to disappear. it would not do for snape, or indeed anyone else, to see where he was going. but there were no lights in the castle windows, and he could conceal himself ... and in a second he had cast upon himself a disillusionment charm that hid him even from his own eyes."
64143,7,fidelius charm,Charm,"all three of them glanced back at shell cottage, lying dark and silent under the fading stars, then turned and began to walk toward the point, just beyond the boundary wall, where the fidelius charm stopped working and they would be able to disapparate. once past the gate, griphook spoke."
64229,7,confundo,Charm,"and he set off up the steps, nodding left and right to the wizards, who raised the golden rods and passed them up and down his body. the probes, harry knew, detected spells of concealment and hidden magical objects. knowing that he had only seconds; harry pointed draco’s wand at each of the guards in turn and murmured, 'confundo' twice. unnoticed by travers, who was looking through the bronze doors at the inner hall, each of the guards gave a little start as the spells hit them."

64418,7,relashio,Jinx,"the tethered dragon let out a roar, and a gush of flame flew over the goblins: the wizards fled, doubled- up, back the way they had come, and inspiration, or madness, came to harry. pointing his wand at the thick cuffs chaining the beast to the floor, he yelled, 'relashiol'"
64429,7,defodio,Charm,"'well never get out, it’s too big!' hermione screamed, but the dragon opened its mouth and belched flame again, blasting the tunnel, whose floors and ceiling cracked and crumbled. by sheer force the dragon clawed and fought its way through. harry’s eyes were shut tight against the heat and dust: deafened by the crashing of rock and the dragon’s roars, he could only cling to its back, expecting to be shaken off at any moment; then he heard hermione yelling, 'defodiol'"
