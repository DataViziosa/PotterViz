With an intellectual property this big and impactful, there has been many vizualizations of Harry Potter's universe. Here are some examples found on different websites:
- *Pinterest*: A lot of the works found on Pinterest related to Harry Potter are made by graphic designers, but there is some real data visualization behind it.
Such as [The Wand-o-graphic](https://images.ctfassets.net/bxd3o8b291gf/4hqdYyVVMQsyGYUCaYuiqg/ba61eb8c4b224718eed93e6b2acb0725/Wand_Infographic_Full.jpg) found on [wizardingworld.com](https://www.wizardingworld.com/features/the-great-wand-o-graphic) which showcases interesting facts about the magic wands used throughout the Harry Potter universe, based on observational studies which is part of what we'll do. 
Even though we might not be able to recreate these visually aesthetic pieces, a lot of them could serve as inspirations in the way they showcase interesting information in an eye-catching way.
- *Tableau*: Another very good source for data vizzes in general is the Tableau public repository. This [vizualization of spell types](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/julie.sauvageau/viz/HarryPotterSpells_0/HarryPotterSpells) or [this one](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/skybjohnson/viz/TheSpellsofHarryPotter/HarryPotterSpells) showcase exactly what we'd like to do with the spells in the Harry Potter universe.
- *Accio data*: As an additional Harry Potter-specific source we have [Accio data](https://www.storybench.org/created-accio-data-data-driven-visual-guide-things-harry-potter/), a work done by a graphic designer during her senior year, which she describes as a data-driven visual guide to all things Harry Potter. Since it's a book, these data vizzes are static but showcase a lot of what we'd like to show in our project in a simple yet visually appealing way. For example, the info we'd like to show of characters and their blood type is displayed [here](https://www.storybench.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accio4.png) as a periodic table, with each blood type represented by a different color. The relationship between characters that is shown [here](https://www.storybench.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accio3.png) can be hard to dissect, but with a little interactivity such as highlighting the edges of the network related only the character selected, we could have a very nice vizualization of relationships.
- *[Explore Harry Potter via a dynamic social network of characters](https://towardsdatascience.com/explore-harry-potter-via-a-dynamic-social-network-of-characters-f5bed9a39f01)*: The final source of information we find useful is a network representation of the relations in the Harry Potter saga. It is a good source of inspiration since we already plan to do a visualization involving connections/relations between characters. Our approach will be different in the sense that we won't explore the relations between the characters at the chapter level, but we will rather see if they interact at any time during the whole book series. This means that we will lose the temporal component in the first place but in the other hand we will end up with a bigger network and maybe more insightful network.
